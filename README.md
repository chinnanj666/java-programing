###  **Summary**

In summary:
- Maven is used for managing Java projects with dependencies and builds.
- The basic structure involves `src/main/java` for source code, `src/test/java`(for windows)/ ~ideaProjects (macos) default in intelij, for tests, and `target/` for compiled artifacts.
- The `pom.xml` defines project configurations and dependencies.
- The `README.md` file should explain project details, how to set up, build, and run the application, along with any dependencies.

This should give you a solid foundation to understand Maven, organize your Java classes and packages.
